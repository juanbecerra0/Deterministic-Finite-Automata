# Project 1: Deterministic Finite Automata

* Authors: Keegan Saunders and Juan Becerra
* Class: CS361 Section 1
* Semester: Spring 2020

## Overview

Given a properly formatted file, constructs a deterministic finite automata
object, fit with several methods that allows a user to add states, symbols, 
and simulate a DFA parsing a string. Within the driver class, several tests 
can be given as input and the program will output DFA information in set 
notation to the console.

## Compiling and Using

To compile the program, go to the route directory and type this into the console:

```
javac fa/dfa/DFADriver.java
```

To run the compiled program's test suite, type this into the console:

```
java fa.dfa.DFADriver ./tests/(testfile)
```

## Discussion

Discuss the issues and successes you encountered during programming
(development). Here are some questions to get you started. You don't
have to answer all of them in order - they are a guideline to get you
thinking.
  * What problems did you have? What went well?
  * What process did you go through to create the program?
  * What did you have to research and learn on your own?
  * What kinds of errors did you get? How did you fix them?
  * What parts of the project did you find challenging?
  * Is there anything that finally "clicked" for you in the process 
  of working on this project?
  * Is there anything that you would change about the project?
  * Can you apply what you learned in this project to future projects?

## Testing

In this section, tell us how you tested your project.

You are expected to test your projects before submitting them for
final review. Pretend that your instructor is your manager or 
customer at work. How would you ensure that you are delivering a 
working solution to their requirements?

## Extra Credit

Extra credit was not offered in this assignment, but we won't turn it down ;)
